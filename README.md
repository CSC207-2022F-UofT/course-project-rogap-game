# RoGap Game

## Introduction
This is a template repository for CSC 207 projects. 
This repository contains starter code for a gradle project.
It also contains workflow documents that give instructions on how to manage your Github repository and how to use Github Projects for efficient collaboration.

## Design Pattern
### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design Pattern
We used MVC design pattern for our game development. The different components of the MVC (the model, the view and the controller) using its own design pattern.

#### The Observer Design Patten (Model)
The Model represents the logic of your application. Through this pattern, the Model is able to interact with the views and controllers without knowing anything about them. This pattern makes the interaction between all classes loosely coupled.

#### The Composite Design Pattern (View)
This represents all Views (main window & screens) in an application. This pattern provides a unified access point for all views to the model. The design composes more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object

#### The strategy pattern (Controller)
The strategy pattern helps us decouple user inputs from the game's logic (Model) and interfaces (View). This is because it separates the implementation of the class from the implementation of the algorithms

Below is a graphical representation of the design patterns we have used in our project
