# RoGap Game

## Introduction
A rogue-like game developed by a group of University of Toronto computer science students interested in game development and eager to apply concepts learned in class. Throughout the development of this game, each student followed SOLID and Clean Architecture principles when contributing to the code base. This allowed students to practice good coding habits and ensure their code was always maintainable and easily extensible.

## How to play RoGap
Once the game is run, the instructions are on the screen making it user-friendly and easy to understand.

## The Goal of the Game
Explore the map and battle enemies! Defeat enemies, collect money, and search for the key! To enchance your abilities, visit the shopkeeper and his store. At his store, purchase various items and potions using the money you have collected. Each item applies a unique buff and helps you on your way to achieving your final goal!
